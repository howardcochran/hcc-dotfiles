This script disables gnome "tracker" because it can be a resource hog,
somewhat frequently crashes, and isn't very useful. Unfortunately, simply
uninstalling it breaks other apps and meta-packages that depend on it,
so we'll leave it installed but disable it by renaming its autostart files,
/etc/xdg/autostart/*tracker*.desktop to ...-DISABLED.

To prevent package updates from reverting this change, we'll
apt-mark hold the following three packages:
* tracker
* tracker-extract
* tracker-miner-fs
* tracker-utils

NOTE: As of now, this script only works on Debian (apt)-based systems.

Do you wish to continue?
