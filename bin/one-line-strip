# Copy all of stdin to stdout, except:
# If stdin consists of only a single line of input, strip the newline
# Otherwise, copy it all verbatim.
#
# Rationale: Convenient to send output of a command into a tmux buffer.
# When you later want to paste the buffer, if it was only one line, you
# typically don't want the newline included with it.
# Example:
#   git rev-parse HEAD | one-line-strip | tmux load-buffer -
# Now, your srcrev is ready for pasting into a bitbake reciply without the
# pesky newline!
