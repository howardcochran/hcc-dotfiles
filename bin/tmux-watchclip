# Note: This script was simpler with tmux 1.9. But with v. 2.1,
# The new pane following a split-pane is not really "selected" from
# the script's point of view (i.e. send-key will write to the old pane
# and another split will split the old pane, evene though the new pane
# actually does have keyboard focus and is listed as the active one
# in the output of tmux list-panes (which we rely upon to make the
# above function work). I think this inconsistency is a bug.
# But we work arond it by using -t to explicitly identify the pane
# in each split or send-key command
