# A few of the files in the tarballs created by `create-release-tarballs`

# container: (e.g. /home/dotbuilder/). This script will replace those instances
# with the name of the current user. Run this script after extracting release
# tarballs in a home account.
#
# Limitation: Currently, a couple of compiled language servers written in Rust,
# jq-lsp, and neocmakelsp, contain the username `dotbuilder` inside the
# executable. We don't have a feasible way to fix that up here. It is not
# currently known whether this keeps them from working. If needed, user can
# manually fix this up by removing and re-adding these language servers using
# :Mason in nvim.
