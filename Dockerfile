# This Dockerfile will build a binary release tarball of the hcc-dotfiles with
# all downloadable assets already installed (zsh plugins, tmux plugins, nvim
# plugins & language servers). It can be extracted into a newly created home
# directory to instantly have a fully functioning environment, even if there is
# no internet connection available (so fetching plugins from github wouldn't
# work).
