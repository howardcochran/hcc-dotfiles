NOTES:
This is a log of the process of cloning all the packages from digit
to ll6 after initial install of Ubuntu Precise 12.04 on ll6.

This was done by running 'apt-mark showmanual' on digit, saving
the result to a file (doinst), editing it slightly, then running
apt-get install $(cat doinst) on ll6.

Had to add virtualbox 4.1 PPA so ll6 could find it.
Edits to doinst:
* Removed kernels and kernel-headers packages, since digit is 32-bit,
  and most of the kernels were older versions anyway.
* Removed nxclient, android-sdk, as I believe these were installed
  from a .deb via dpkg, so there is no repo to get them from.
* SHOULD HAVE removed grub-pc, as this replaced grub-efi, breaking
  grub on ll6.  I'm going to switch back to grub-efi and hope nothing
  broke too seriously!

Description-en: GRand Unified Bootloader, version 2 (PC/BIOS version)
 GRUB is a portable, powerful bootloader.  This version of GRUB is based on a
 cleaner design than its predecessors, and provides the following new features:
 .
  - Scripting in grub.cfg using BASH-like syntax.
  - Support for modern partition maps such as GPT.
  - Modular generation of grub.cfg via update-grub.  Packages providing GRUB
    add-ons can plug in their own script rules and trigger updates by invoking
    update-grub2.
  - VESA-based graphical mode with background image support and complete 24-bit
    color set.
  - Support for extended charsets.  Users can write UTF-8 text to their menu
    entries.
 .
 This package contains a version of GRUB that has been built for use with
 traditional PC/BIOS architecture.
