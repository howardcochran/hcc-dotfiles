# integration. For my environment, I prefer tmux talk with the Xpra server,
# if possible, so that it is talking with the same X server that I use with
# vim, and so that clipboard sharing between local and remote ssh host is
# seamless.  However, if we can't connect to the Xpra clipboard, we'll
# just use whatever is in $DISPLAY.
# Since tmux's run-shell command strips the environment bare, we have to query
# these env vars from tmux.
